The problem this program is solving is to find all the paths from a given start node to a given end node. 
Graph.java is taken from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-paths-given-source-destination/ 

I intended to implement more functions into the Graph class, but due to a short amount of time this is my final submission. 
It currently has no limit as to how many nodes the graph can have. 

Graphs can grow tremendously, so this should help to find paths when they aren't so clear due to all the connections. 

It displays both, undirected paths and directed paths. 

The only downside to this implementation is that the graph must start at node 0.
